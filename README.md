# udemy-react-the-food-order-app

The current project is part of the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Contains the implementation done for **Section 11: Practice Project: Building a Food Order APP**.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-overview).

## Status

**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the section of the course and the associated project, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
