# udemy-react-http-requests

The current project is part of the "React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)" [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

Contains the implementation done for **Section 14: Sending Http Requests (e.g. Conntecting to a Database)**.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-overview).

## Implementation details
The purpose of the current section was to exemplify the connection to a database through the REST endpoints provided by Firebase utilizing the Fetch API.

The implementation required a Firebase project to save and retrieve movies. As this is just an example project, I will not maintain the project.

The previous version of the course used the Axios API. My implementation for the legacy project can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-react-http).

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the section of the course and the associated project, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
